# Finite State Machines (FSM)

A **Finite State Machine (FSM)** is a computational model used in
**digital system design** to manage the behavior of a system through a
finite number of states.\
It transitions between states based on **inputs** and produces
**outputs** accordingly.

## Key Concepts

-   **States**: Defined conditions representing the system.
-   **Inputs**: External signals that influence state transitions.
-   **Outputs**: System responses based on the current state.
-   **State Transition**: Moving from one state to another based on
    inputs.

## Types of FSMs

1.  **Moore Machine** -- Output depends only on the **current state**.
2.  **Mealy Machine** -- Output depends on the **current state and
    input**.

## Applications

-   Traffic light controllers 🚦
-   Vending machines 🥤
-   IoT devices 🌐
-   Processors & embedded systems ⚡

FSMs provide an **efficient, structured** way to design **control
logic** for **digital circuits**.
