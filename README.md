# Finite-state-Machines
A Finite State Machine (FSM) is a digital design model used to control systems based on a finite number of states. It transitions between states based on inputs and generates outputs accordingly. FSMs are widely used in traffic controllers, processors, IoT devices, and embedded systems for efficient control and automation.
